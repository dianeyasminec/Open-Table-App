App Component 

This component will render the main layout of your app.
It will contain the FloorPlan and MenuPopup components as well as the state to manage table availability and menu visibility.

FloorPlan Component

This component will display the floor plan and table availability.
It will have a list of Table components.
Table Component

This component represents each individual table on the floor plan.
It will have state to track its availability status (open, seated, need bussing).
It will handle drag-and-drop events for guests.

GuestIcon Component

This component represents a draggable guest icon.
It will be rendered on the Table component when a table is not in the "seated" state.
It will have state to track its position and whether it's currently being dragged.

MenuPopup Component

This component will display the menu options when the user clicks on the menu icon.
It will be a pop-up modal or a dropdown.
It will provide a way for the user to select items from the menu.
With this structure in mind, here's a general flow of how your app would work:

When the app starts, the App component will render the FloorPlan component.
The FloorPlan component will render multiple Table components.
Each Table component will have conditional rendering: if the table is in the "seated" state, it will render the seated guest icons; if not, it will render the GuestIcon component for draggable guests.
When the user drags a GuestIcon component onto a Table, the table's status will update (seated) and the GuestIcon will be removed from the Table component. You might use a library like react-dnd for drag-and-drop functionality.
If a Table is seated, it will change its color to green. If a Table needs bussing, it will turn orange.
After a guest has been seated for 5 minutes, you can trigger a state change to update the table's status to "need bussing".
The MenuPopup component will be triggered by clicking a menu icon on the Table. It will display menu options in a pop-up modal or dropdown.
The user can select menu items from the MenuPopup, and after selecting, the popup will close, and the user will return to the FloorPlan.
Remember, this is a high-level overview of how your app's components could interact. You can break down each component into smaller functional parts as needed. As you start coding, feel free to ask more specific questions if you encounter any challenges.
